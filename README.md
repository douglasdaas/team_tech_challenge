# team_tech_challenge

To test the code by the instruction given the run `python3 -m unittest -v test`

- The challenge is to create a program that computes some basic statistics on a collection of small positive integers. You can assume all values will be less than 1,000.
- The DataCapture object accepts numbers and returns an object for querying statistics about the inputs. Specifically, the returned object supports querying how many numbers in the collection are less than a value, greater than a value, or within a range.
- You cannot import a library that solves it instantly
- The methods add(), less(), greater(), and between() should have
constant time O(1)
- The method build_stats() can be at most linear O(n) o Apply the best practices you know
